# Pomodoro Technique
The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. It uses a timer to break work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. [Additional Reading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique)
If you want to customize the time intervals, just change the variables named WORK_SEC, SHORT_BREAK_SEC, LONG_BREAK_SEC as required in "Theme and Other Constants" region with attention being paid to convert into seconds.
